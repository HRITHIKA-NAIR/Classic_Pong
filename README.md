# 🎮 Classic Pong (Python)

This project is a modern Python implementation of the classic Pong game, featuring two-player support with an AI-controlled opponent. One paddle is controlled by the player, while the opposite paddle uses simple AI logic to automatically track and respond to the ball’s movement.

The game includes real-time ball physics, collision detection, score tracking, and sound effects for paddle hits, wall bounces, and scoring events, enhancing the classic arcade feel. The AI opponent dynamically adjusts its movement based on the ball’s position, providing a responsive and engaging challenge.

Built using Python, the project demonstrates core game development concepts such as:
  
 - Game loops
 - Input handling
 - controlled entities
 - Audio feedback
 - 2D collision mechanics

This project serves as both a nostalgic recreation of Pong and a learning-focused example for beginners exploring game development with Python.
